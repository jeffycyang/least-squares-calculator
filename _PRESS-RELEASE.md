There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Least Squares Regression Calculator & Grapher

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Analysts and Forecasters Can Quickly and Effectively Quantify a Correlation - Visualy and Numerically.

## Summary ##
  > This product will allow you to input a data set of two variables and allow you to find the best fit correlation function of a specific type - be it, polynomial, exponential, trigonometric, or logarithmic.  You input your data, you pick the type of function space you want to use, and you pick the number of terms (the accuracy) of your correlation function - submit, and the application will do the rest.  The application will return the best fit function given your input and plot both the points and the best fit function on a cartesian graph so you can visualize your forecasting function.

## Problem ##
  > This product serves to allow anyone to find and quantify, visually and numerically, a relationship they believe exists between two variables.

## Solution ##
  > Using the method of least squares, the product performs a series of operations behind the scenes using linear algebra to return the users desired output.  Using a graphical library, the product will then take the numerical output and plot it on a graph.

## Quote from You ##
  > Avoid Uncertainty - Predict the Future!

## How to Get Started ##
  > Simply input your data points into the input field, pick the type of function, pick the number of terms if you choose to use polynomials or trigonometric functions - and SUBMIT! It's that easy!

## Customer Quote ##
  > "With the Least Squares Regression Calculator & Grapher - I was able to quit my day job and focus on my home-brew beer business knowing that it was sustainable if I worked on it full-time!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Go ahead and give the product a try!  Feedback is always welcome and we are always here to serve you!
