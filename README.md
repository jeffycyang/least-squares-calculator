# MVP (Solo) Project

### Overview:

You have 36 hours to produce something compelling using the skills you've honed over the past five weeks. 

__Q:__ What are your inputs?
<br>
__A:__ 36 hours of (relatively) undivided attention

__Q:__ What is the required output?
<br>
__A:__ A compelling product presentation delivered to your classmates.


### Getting Started:

To build on your learning of core engineering concepts, we will begin thinking about how to actually manage projects. Engineering management is a deep skill and discipline with lots of history and academic writing. We will focus on just some highlights of content to give a very brief context of how we arrive here.

* Use an [Iterative and incremental development process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development) instead of a [Waterfall Process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)

<!--
*  [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) - is a modern eveolution of Iterative and Incremental Development (IID) that further formalizes the IID philosophy with a set of principles and best practices. It also applies Lean Manufacturing process like [Kanban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban).-->

<!--* [Lean Product Process](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) - Takes the essence of Agile Development methodology and applies it more broadly to the development of product and buiness models that support he requirements of the project.

## Basic Requirements
- [ ] Fork the repo
- Complete the PRESS-RELEASE.md template (<30min)
  - [ ] Pick an idea (implement a technology, build a product, make art, etc).
  - [ ] Write it down on paper
  - [ ] Imagine what portion of this could be done in 24 hours.
  - [ ] Cut the scope in half.
  - [ ] Cut the above scope in half again.
  - [ ] Fill in the README.md template document
- [ ] Use iterative development (go straight to something that demos your idea)
- [ ] Prepare for pitch @ demo on Tuesday

## Product Specific Requirements
- [ ] Create js files for matrix operations
  - [ ] create column vector from input X values
  - [ ] create column vector from input Y values
  - [ ] create X matrix from X vector
  - [ ] create function to transpose X matrix
  - [ ] create function to invert matrices (suggest finding one online)
  - [ ] create function to multiply matrices
  - [ ] create function that uses all the above to run least squares regression given input X and Y values
- [ ] Create webpage using angular to allow users to input their data
- [ ] Use angular to dynamically display the data points on the page
- [ ] Allow users to click a submit button that runs the data through the least squares regression process and output the results
- [ ] Display the results as the actual correlation function

## Extra Credit
- [ ] Use some graphical library like D3, Sigma, or Highcharts and plot the data points as well as the resulting function on the same Cartesian graph
- [ ] Allow users to pick from choices of function spaces - polynomial, exponential, trigonometric, and logarithmic
- [ ] Allow users ability to input batch data set
