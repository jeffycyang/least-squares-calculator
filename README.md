# Least Squares Visualizer
- deployed at: https://least-squares-visualizer.firebaseapp.com

## Features
- Input and display data-points
- Choose from four different function spaces: polynomial, exponential, trigonmetric, logarithmic
    - For polynomial and trigonometric, choose the degree (number of terms)
- Displays best fit function for the inputted data-points
- Graphs best fit function
- Remove point(s) on click
- Clear graph, and clear point(s) buttons

## To-Do
- Re-size graph if added point is out of bounds
- Enable batch input

## Credit
- Least Squares Visualizer is created by Jeffery Y. C. Yang and is a product of the inspirational MakerSquare experience and his desire to give something back by demonstrating his love for mathematics
- Credit to Andrew Ippoliti for his [matrix inversion function](http://blog.acipo.com/matrix-inversion-in-javascript/)
